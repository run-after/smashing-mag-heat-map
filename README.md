From The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown?ref=lnav)

In this project, I made the basic layout of the Smashing Magazine homepage with a 'heat map' of where your attention goes to first. The darker the gray, is the first place your eyes go to and gets lighter as you go.

This project is made to get you thinking about web design.
